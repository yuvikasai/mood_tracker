# 🌾 Stardew Mood Tracker

A cozy, Stardew Valley-inspired mood tracker built with **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **Pygame**.

Inspired by a fun idea I saw on Instagram – where each Stardew Valley villager was matched with a specific emotion – this app lets you track your daily moods by choosing the villager you feel like today. It’s a simple, relaxing way to check in with yourself emotionally, all while enjoying the aesthetic of one of the most beloved games ever made. 🍂
